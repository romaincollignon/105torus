## :rocket: Introduction

    Drawing circles, cylinders and cones is a good start for an image synthesis    
    software, but one have to admit it is not fully satisfying...
    This project is the continuation of the previous one, and should allow you to
    draw more complex forms, such as a torus, which do not emerge from 2nd degree
    equations, but from superior degree equations (4th degree in the torus case).
